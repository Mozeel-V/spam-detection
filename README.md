## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
- **Description**: A set of SMS labeled messages as spam or not.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Text tokenization using **NLTK**
- Vectorization using **TF-IDF**
- Model comparison using multiple classifiers
- Final model: **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Evaluation metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Confusion Matrix**
- **Streamlit web app** for user interaction

## 🧠 Model Insights

- The dataset was vectorized using TF-IDF to capture term importance.
- Multiple classifiers were tested (e.g. Logistic Regression, SVM).
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** gave the best results on precision and accuracy.
- The model was saved as `model.pkl` and used directly in the app.
